# Standalone Java app with embedded Jetty

This is a sample app that can be used at least in the following two use cases:
- as a standalone application that exposes REST operations for statistics, administrative and/or monitoring purposes;
- a lightweight microservice that exposes REST operations to the external world, without any dependencies to bigger frameworks like Spring Boot/Cloud.
